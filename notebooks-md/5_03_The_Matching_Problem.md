The Matching Problem 
This famous problem has been stated variously in terms of hats and people, letters and envelopes, tea cups and saucers â€“ indeed, any situation in which you might want to match two kinds of items seems to have appeared somewhere as a setting for the matching problem. 

In the letter-envelope setting there are $n$ letters labeled 1 through $n$ and also $n$ envelopes labeled 1 through $n$. The letters are permuted randomly into the envelopes, one letter per envelope (a mishap usually blamed on an unfortunate hypothetical secretary), so that all permutations are equally likely. The main questions are about the number of letters that are placed into their matching envelopes.

"Real life" settings aside, the problem is about the number of fixed points of a random permutation. A fixed point is an element whose position is unchanged by the shuffle.
